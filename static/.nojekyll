# .nojekyll

This file prevents GitHub Pages from processing the site with Jekyll.

## Purpose
When deploying to GitHub Pages, this file tells GitHub to:
- Skip Jekyll processing (GitHub's default static site generator).
- Serve the Docusaurus-built static files directly.
- Preserve files and folders that start with underscores (_).
- Prevent Jekyll from ignoring certain file patterns.

## Why is this needed?
Docusaurus builds its own optimized static site. Without this file, GitHub Pages would:
- Process the site through Jekyll unnecessarily.
- Potentially break the site by modifying or ignoring certain files.
- Add extra build time and potential errors.

## If not deploying to GitHub Pages
If you're deploying to another platform (Netlify, Vercel, custom server, etc.), this file is not needed and can be safely deleted.

## Technical Note
The presence of this file (not its content) is what matters to GitHub Pages. This file is copied from static/ to build/ during the Docusaurus build process.
